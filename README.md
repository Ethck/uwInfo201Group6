This is our final project for the INFO 201 course at the Univervisty of Washington.
In this project we will analyze some of the leading causes of deaths in the 4 quarter periods of both 2017 and 2018.
By the end of the project there will even be a way for you, the user, to ask your own questions about this CDC dataset.

Thanks for reading!
